Once upon a time, there was a land called Westeros. There was an army called Unsullied led by a queen with dragons. Her name is Daenerys Targaryen. She is the survivor of the
 massacre of the Targaryen family. She has many names including "breakers of the chain" and "mother of dragons". She has silver blonde hair and beautiful purple eyes coming 
from a family line of such features. After going through many things including two unsuccessful marriages and politics, she finally took her army to the red keep to take back the iron throne which was taken from her family. 

Standing by her side, are some well-known people in this world who support her. John Snow, lord commander of the Night's Watch and His family, Arya Stark are drinking starbucks in the dungeon.
Sansha Stark, having donuts in her pajama sitting comfortably in the sofa. And the Imp, holding a gigantic mug of wine. 

They are watching the HBO version of Game of Throne Season 8 together.
